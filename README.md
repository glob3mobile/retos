It requires [Oculus Mobile SDK 1.0.0.0](https://developer3.oculus.com/downloads/mobile/1.0.0.0/Oculus_Mobile_SDK/) to work.
Here is a [installation tutorial](https://github.com/glob3mobile/retos/wiki/Configuring-a-Oculus-project-with-G3M-submodule-in-Android-Studio) which allows you not only to install these demos but also to create new Oculus-G3M demos.
